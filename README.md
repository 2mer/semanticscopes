```jsonc
{
	"semanticscopes.theme": {
		// default theme configuration
		"primary": "red", //used to color the outline and title background
		"text": "red", // the title text color
		"background": "red", // the background color of the codeblock

		"selected": {
			// these styles will override when a caret is present inside the codeblock
			"primary": "purple",
			"text": "purple",
			"background": "purple"
		}
	},

	"semanticscopes.overrides": {
		"imports": {
			// will override styles if the trimmed title is equal to the key
			"primary": "red",
			"text": "red",
			"background": "red",

			"selected": {
				"primary": "purple",
				"text": "purple",
				"background": "purple"
			}
		}
	}
}
